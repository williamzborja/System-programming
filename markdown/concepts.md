# Why low level is important in Computer Science

## What is low level?

## Example

You speak english and you have three friends but them speak different language. the first speak latin, second spanish, french.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Mexican, Colombian</td>
        <td>British, Australian</td>
        <td>Canadian, French</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Spanish</td>
        <td>English</td>
        <td>French</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3" align="center">Latin</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Human and programming language are different but this compare can be useful to understand what is a low level language in computer. Latin is low level language and all people that use Colombian spanish, or Australian english use latin inclusively when they Even when they don't know that Latin exists.

Continuing with the same example I want change human language with Programming language.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">Typescript</td>
          <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Python, Ruby, Javascript, NodeJS</td>
        <td>Java, Scala Clojure</td>
        <td>Clojure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C++, Rust, Golang, CPython</td>
        <td align="center">Java</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center" colspan="2">C Programming Language</td>
        <td align="center">Lisp</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3" align="center">Assembly (Machine Code)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This table is not 100% accurate of language hierarchy it's not really important the idea is show that in programming language relationship is opposite to human language for example latin is the more basic language and all other take part of them add your part in the other hand in programming language is opposite Assembly and C are more complex and responsibilities, grammar rules and higher level are simpler, easier to use and flexible.

### Again, What is Low level?

Level is the more important part of all system because directly impact of all attributes of quality of your software and systems, Reliability, Maintainability, Security.

I understand Amazon marketplaces as a system, google search as a system, business company web as a system not only low level layer.

### It don't have sense

Both human and programming language put layer under others with the same approach but they have complete opposite result.

For example if you want mix this three language
Hypothetical scenario
```latin + spanish + french = new more complex```

In the other hand in Programming language.

```assembly + C + CPython + interpreter + Garbage Collector + Optimizer = Python```

Python is the more simpler and used language at the moment.

It's impossible!! when add more complexity whe have more simpler systems python is an complex ecosystem of different tools, languages and the result is more simpler system.

It's the art of lies. It's result of abstraction a important principle of computer science really useful. But for my opinion the root of all modern problems in System.
