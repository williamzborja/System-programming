# Modern System Programming

if you have High level knowledge using Python, JS, Ruby, Java or high level language you can use this repo to have a introduction to more system and low level topics used in under the hood for your High level language and really you will be a better Software Engineer with this knowledge.

This repository is my tracked way to learn about Systems development useful to have deep understanding about computer Science principle to build efficient, safe and maintainable systems.

It repo is not about C programming or specific system for example embedded systems, Kernel Programming, arduino or etc.

## Structure

- Conceptual a part
